#This code will generate a code name for a spy when the spy's name is entered.

#define a method to hold my spy name program

#gets input from user
puts "Welcome, spy, enter your name and I will make you a super secret new name:"
#swap first and last name
real_name = gets.chomp
new_name = real_name.split(' ')
#change all vowels to the next vowel (.next)?

#write separate next_vowel method to combine with other methods...
#def next_vowel
