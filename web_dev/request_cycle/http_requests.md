Common http status codes:
    Informational codes are 1xx
    Code 200 is common and means that everything is ok.
    304 means that a user has made a GET request, but nothing has been modified (AKA there is no message-body)
    4xx codes beginning with 4 indicate that there is an issue somewhere. Either the page cannot be found, or a the client doesn't have access to it, etc.
