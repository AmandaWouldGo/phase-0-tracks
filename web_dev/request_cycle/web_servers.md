 Cool. The Linux philosophy assumes that the user knows what she or he is doing. It's open source which means that anyone can use it, create with it and share. Code is often shared in 'alpha' mode, meaning it really needs to be tested and debugged before going on to either a 'beta' or 'final' phase.


 A virtual private server is an internet based hosting service that allows the user to have a copy of a fully functional operating system. The advantages to using a VPS are that the user, especially a new one, can test stuff out without breaking their own computers. I also found that VPS's are environmentally friendly because one physical resource is being shared between many people. Additionally, not every site needs a huge server, so it allows smaller services to access to smaller amounts of space and lower costs.


 There are a few reasons not to run linux as the root user. One is that you could really mess things up in a way that makes your operating system dysfunctional. Also, if more than one person are working on an operating system as the root user, it will be hard to figure out who did what. There are additional security risks in that a virus or hacker can do real damage if they gain root user access.
